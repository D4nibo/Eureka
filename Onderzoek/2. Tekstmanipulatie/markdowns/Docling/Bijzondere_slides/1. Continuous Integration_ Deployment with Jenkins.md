## Intro

- 1. Continuous Integration/ Deployment with Jenkins

## Traditional release

- Weeks/months apart
- Lots of changes!
- ⇒ Lots of bugs…
- Wait for vN.1?
- Releases are painful, high-risk events

## How e.g. Facebook does it

- 'If it hurts, do it more often'
- Dozens of releases per day!
- Small, incremental changes go into production
- ⇒ Reduced risk Read more: Rapid release at massive scale

## Continuous Integration/Delivery

<!-- image -->

## CI vs CD. ( ) Redhat, 2020

## Typical tasks (1)

- Linting: code style checks
- Static analysis (e.g. shellcheck)
- Compilation
- Unit tests
- Code coverage analysis
- Packaging

## Typical tasks (2)

- Release to package repository
- Deploy in acceptance environment
- Integration/acceptance/load-tests…
- Deploy to production

## CI/CD tooling

## Overview

- Open source
- Concourse
- Jenkins
- Spinnaker
- Commercial on-prem
- Atlassian Bamboo
- Jetbrains TeamCity

- Commercial, hosted
- AWS CodePipeline
- Azure DevOps
- CircleCI
- Codeship
- Github Actions
- GitLab CI
- Travis CI

## Jenkins

## https://www.jenkins.io/

- Open source
- Mature
- Most flexibility
- on-prem/private/public cloud
- rich feature set

## A Github Actions case

This slide deck was built on Github Actions &amp; deployed to Github Pages!

https://github.com/HoGentTIN/infra-slides

## Working with Github Actions

- Go to Actions, New workflow
- Or create .github/workflows/workflowname.yml
- RTFM

## Example workflow

## https://github.com/HoGentTIN/infraslides/blob/main/.github/workflows/compile.yml

```
---name : compile on : push : branches : -main jobs : convert_via_pandoc : runs-on : ubuntu-18.04 steps : -name : Configure Git for Github run : | git config --global user.name "${GITHUB_ACTOR}" git config --global user.email "${GITHUB_ACTOR}@users.noreply.github.com" -uses : actions/checkout@v2 -uses : r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v1 with : pandoc-version : '2.9' -name : Publish Site env : REPOSITORY : "https://${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}@github.com/${{ github.repository }}.git" run : ./publish.sh
```

## Another case: testing Ansible roles

## https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-rolebind/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml

- Ansible role bertvv.bind
- Installs ISC BIND (a DNS server) on several Linux distros
- ~40 contributors, dozens of PRs
- Contributed code may break the role!

## Testing Ansible roles in Gitlab CI

- On each push/PR:
- Spin up Docker container for each supported distro
- Apply role, use (most) functionality
- Run acceptance tests (= DNS queries)

## Get started with the lab assignment!

## Jenkins lab assignment

```
$ cd dockerlab
```

```
$ vagrant up $ vagrant ssh
```

## Follow the steps in the assignment Jenkins UI resides at https://github.com/HoGentTIN/infralabs/blob/main/assignment/2-cicd.md

http://192.168.56.20:8080/

## Setup

- Jenkins runs in a Docker container
- Default installation, minimal configuration required
- Launch demo application in another Docker container
- Make change, rebuild &amp; deploy!

## Reflection

- 1. Continuous Integration/ Deployment with Jenkins

## Lab setup vs reality

- Complete build server
- Physical system or 'traditional' VM
- Worker nodes
- Central repo + build tools

## Change in discipline needed!

- code coverage ⟶ 100%
- feature flags
- canary deployment
- blue/green deployment
- trunk-based development

## Canary deployments

Canary deployments (Sato, 2014)

## Blue-Green Deployment
