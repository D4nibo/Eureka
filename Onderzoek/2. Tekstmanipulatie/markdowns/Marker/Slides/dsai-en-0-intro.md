# **Learning goals**

- Descriptive Statistics
	- Knows some descriptive measures for data (central tendency, dispersion).
	- Can calculate some descriptive measures for data using statistical software (Python).
- Data visualisation
	- Knows different types of plots to represent data visually.
	- Can visualize data using appropriate plots
- Probability
	- Knows the basic rules with regard to calculating with probabilities.
	- Knows the properties of some important probability distributions.

# **Learning goals**

- Bivariate analysis
	- Can quantify and appropriately test the relationship between two variables.
	- Can construct a simple linear model to show the relationship between two or more variables.
- Time series analysis
	- Can discuss some common models to predict time series and/or detect anomalies.
	- Can indicate the importance of testing the accuracy of a model in a methodologically correct manner.
