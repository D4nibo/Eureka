# **Learning goals**

   - Bivariate analysis

     - Can quantify and appropriately test the relationship between two
variables.

     - Can construct a simple linear model to show the relationship between
two or more variables.

   - Time series analysis

     - Can discuss some common models to predict time series and/or
detect anomalies.

     - Can indicate the importance of testing the accuracy of a model in a
methodologically correct manner.
