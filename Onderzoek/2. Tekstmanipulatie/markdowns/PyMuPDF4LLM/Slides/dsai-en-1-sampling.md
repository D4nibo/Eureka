# **Variables and Values**

**Variable** General property of an object, allows to distinguish objects

**Value** Specific property, interpretation for that variable

5/26


-----

# **Measurement Levels**

   - = Variable types

   - Determine most suitable method for analysis

     - visualization methods

     - central tendency and dispersion

     - examine the relationship between variables

# **Measurement Levels**

**Qualitative vs quantitative**

**Qualitative** **Quantitative**

Not necessarily numeric Number + unit of measurement
Limited number of values Many values, often unique

Quantitative variables often contain the result of a **measurement**

7/26


-----

# **Measurement Levels**

**Qualitative scales**

**Nominal** Categories.
e.g. gender, race, country, shape, …

**Ordinal** Order, rank.
e.g. military rank, level of education, …

8/26


-----

# **Measurement Levels**

**Quantitative scales**

**Interval** No fixed zero point ⇒ no proportions
e.g. °C, °F

**Ratio** Absolute zero point ⇒ proportions
e.g. distance (m), energy (J), weight (kg) …

Proportions:

   - 20 m is 1/3th or ∼ 33% longer than 15 m

   - 20 °C is **NOT** 1/3th warmer than 15 °C (convert to °F)

# **Relations between variables**

Variables are related if their values change **systematically** .

# **Relations between variables:** **example**

Is there a relationship between type of cola and taste appreciation?

Pepsi Coca Cola Total

Like 56 24 80

Dislike 14 6 20

Total 70 30 100

# **Causal Relationships**

Researchers are often looking for **causal relationships**, e.g.

   - Frustration leads to agression

   - Alcohol leads to decreased alertness

   - …

**Cause** Independent variable

**Consequence** Dependent variable

12/26


-----

# **Causal Relationships**

**Fake correlations or “Spurious correlations”**




Examples:

 - Violent video games lead to violent behaviour

 - Vaccines can cause autism

 - Relationship between drinking cola light and obesitas

 - …

# **Sample Testing**

## **USA Today has come out with a new survey. Apparently, three** **out of every four people make up 75% of the population** **—David Letterman**

# **Suppose you want to analyze a** **group of friends**

Questions you can ask:

   - How tall are my friends?

   - What are their weights?

   - How safe is their living environment?

   - Do they have family?

   - …

# **Population**


-----

# **Sample and Population**

**Population** the collection of all objects/people/…that you want to
investigate

**Sample** a *subset* of the population from which measurements will be
taken



-----

# **Sample and Population**

A sample is easier to analyze than the entire population

# **Sampling Method**





21/26


-----

# **How to pick elements for a** **sample?**

**Random sample** : every element from the population has an equal
chance of being included in the sample.
**Non-random sample** : the elements for the sample are *not* randomly
selected. Objects that can be collected *easily* are more likely
to be included (convenience sampling).

# **Possible Errors**

Measurements in a sample will typically deviate from the value in the
entire population ⇒ Errors!

   - Accidental ↔ Systematic

   - Sampling error ↔ Non-sampling error

24/26


-----

# **Sampling Errors**

   - Accidental sampling errors

     - Pure coincidence

25/26


-----

# **Sampling Errors**

   - Accidental sampling errors

     - Pure coincidence

   - Systematic sampling errors

     - Online survey: people without internet are excluded

     - Street survey: only who is currently walking there

     - Voluntary survey: only interested parties participate

25/26


-----

# **Non-sampling Errors**

   - Accidental non-sampling errors

     - Incorrectly ticked answers

26/26


-----

# **Non-sampling Errors**

   - Accidental non-sampling errors

     - Incorrectly ticked answers

   - Systematic non-sampling errors

     - Poor or non-calibrated measuring equipment

     - Value can be influenced by the fact that you measure

     - Respondents lie (number of cigarettes a day)
