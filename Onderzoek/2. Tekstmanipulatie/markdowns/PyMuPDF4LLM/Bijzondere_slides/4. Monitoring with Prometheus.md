### **Learning goals**
#### Understanding the concept of monitoring, observability Setting up a monitoring dashboard with Prometheus

### **What is monitoring?**
#### Keep track of systems running in production Problem detection Troubleshooting Reporting and improvement Part of Reliability Engineering

### **What to monitor?**
#### Anything that matters for your business! -> monitoring targets Demand Workload Availability, performance, faults/errors Resources (technical metrics) e.g. CPU, connection pool capacity, … Business metrics

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Early monitoring solutions: Alerting**
#### Nagios, Icinga, Zmon, Sensu, … Regularly execute checks (scripts) Nonzero exit status? Generate alert!

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Early monitoring solutions: Graphing**
#### E.g. Graphite, mrtg Backed by time series database filled with metrics Separate tool for data collection (e.g. collectd, statsd)

### **#monitoringsucks**
#### Trending in 2011 Cloud (r)evolution Scaling up, automation Servers as pets -> servers as cattle Many tools, not suited for new needs Not scalable Manual approach to system administration Too many alerts

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Characteristics**
#### Graphing/alerting are separate Manual approach to system administration No specific tools for log mgmt (tail, grep, awk!)

### **Monitoring in a DevOps world**
#### Integrated metrics, logging, alerting, visualisation Self service Service discovery Dynamic New nodes, destroyed nodes, … Collaborative Shared between all disciplines within the team Observable applications Applications provide their own instrumentation Devs should implement this!

### **Types of monitoring**
#### Synthetic monitoring End user (experience) monitoring System monitoring Network monitoring Software metrics Application monitoring Log monitoring

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Synthetic monitoring**
#### = generate traffic that simulates user interaction Is the application available for users? Simulate interactions programmatically Generates extra load!

https://hogenttin.github.io/infra-slides/04-monitoring.html#/title-slide 12/29

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Simple synthetic monitoring**

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **End user monitoring**
#### = gather data from real end user activity Response times Error rates Number of user interactions User metadata (device type, OS version, geolocation, …) More variation in interactions No extra load

### **System monitoring**
#### This is what we are most familiar with! CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network I/O, … Per process/per container/per VM metrics Kernel metrics, syscalls, … System monitoring does not show whether your application is available to users!

### **Network monitoring**
#### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Implemented in most network devices! Key metrics: bandwith utilization packet processing rates latency interface error rates Should be observed for every device on routing path of service

### **Software metrics**
#### Some 3rd party applications already expose performance metrics Not standardized, different for each application Usually, plugins exist to integrate in your monitoring solution

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Application Monitoring**
#### i.e. the application that your customers use and that your business generates income from! Often blind spot! Application problems: App logic flaws Capacity constraints Dependency failures Measuring app health: Transaction throughput (e.g. #completed reqs/s) Response times Error rates (e.g. HTTP 2xx, 4xx, 5xx)

### **Log monitoring**
#### System and application logs Often best way to determine what went wrong and to find how to fix it Application logs only work if devs have the app generate logs! Has its own set of specialised tooling (e.g. ELK stack, Splunk, Grafana Loki, …)

### **Putting it all together**
#### Enormous amount of metrics can be monitored Granularity also has impact every 1s, 10s, 1m, …? Determine what is most important for your situation Don’t forget about application monitoring Devs should make their apps observable! Share dashboards with application owners

### **Prometheus overview**
#### **https://prometheus.io/** Open source systems monitoring & alerting Originally from SoundCloud Now part of Cloud Native Computing Foundation Home of Kubernetes Collects and stores metrics as time series data time stamp key-value pairs called labels

https://hogenttin.github.io/infra-slides/04-monitoring.html#/title-slide 24/29


-----

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Features**
#### Time series collections via pull model over HTTP PromQL query language Service discovery or static configuration No reliance on distributed storage Multiple modes of graphing, dashboarding

19/04/2025 17:10 4. Monitoring with Prometheus
### **Components**
#### Prometheus server: scrapes, stores TS data Client libraries : for instrumenting application code **Exporters** for exposing metrics so Prometheus can scrape them e.g. Node exporter for basic system metrics also: MySQL, Kubernetes, SNMP, … AlertManager …
