Bivariate analysis
●…is determining whether there is an association between two
stochastic variables (𝑋and 𝑌).
●Association = you can predict (to some extent) the value of 𝑌from
the value of 𝑋
○𝑋— Independent variable
○𝑌— Dependent variable
●Important! Finding an association does NOT imply a causal relation!
6/43
Example research questions
●Is there a difference in taste preference between two beverage
brands?
●Is there a difference in spending at the campus restaurant between
students and staff?
●Do smokers die more often of lung cancer than non-smokers?
●Do men and women have a different opinion on a survey question?
●…
We will use data/rlanders.csv from the Github repo for lab
assignments to explore the last question.

The chi-squared statistic
The sum of all these values is notated:
𝜒2 = ∑
𝑖
(𝑜𝑖−𝑒𝑖)2
𝑒𝑖
≈4.255
●𝜒is the Greek letter chi
●𝑜𝑖= number of observations in the 𝑖’th cell of the contingency table
●𝑒𝑖= expected frequency
●Small value ⇒no association
●Large value ⇒association
14/43
When is 𝜒2 large enough?
●2 × 2-table with 𝜒2 = 10
○Relatively large difference
○Indicates association
●5 × 5-table with 𝜒2 = 10
○Relatively small difference
○Does NOT indicate association
We need a metric independent of table size!

qualitative variables.

𝜒2-distribution in Python
Import scipy.stats
For a 𝜒2-distribution with df degrees of freedom:
Function
Purpose
chi2.pdf(x, df=d)
Probability density for x
chi2.cdf(x, df=d)
Left-tail probability 𝑃(𝑋< x)
chi2.sf(x, df=d)
Right-tail probability 𝑃(𝑋> x)
chi2.isf(1-p, df=d)
p% of observations is expected
to be lower than this value
19/43
Test procedure
●Step 1. Formulate hypotheses:
○𝐻0: there is no association (𝜒2 is “small”)
○𝐻1: there is an association (𝜒2 is “large”)
●Step 2. Choose significance level, e.g. 𝛼= 0.05
●Step 3. Calculate the test statistic, 𝜒2 = 4.255
20/43
Test procedure (cont.)
●Step 4. Use 𝑑𝑓= (𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑅𝑜𝑤−1) × (𝑛𝑢𝑚𝐶𝑜𝑙−1) and either:
○Determine critical value 𝑔so 𝑃(𝜒2 > 𝑔) = 𝛼
○Calculate the 𝑝-value
●Step 5. Draw conclusion:
○𝜒2 < 𝑔: do not reject 𝐻0; 𝜒2 > 𝑔: reject 𝐻0
○𝑝> 𝛼: do not reject 𝐻0; 𝑝< 𝛼: reject 𝐻0
21/43
Example (Gender vs Survey)
●g = stats.chi2.isf(0.05, df=4) (result: 9.4877)
●p = stats.chi2.sf(4.2555, df=4) (result: 0.3725)
Conclusion: we do not reject the null hypothesis. Differences between
expected and observed values are not significantly large.
We found no association between variables Gender and Survey
Test for independence in Python
SciPy has a function to calculate 𝜒2 and 𝑝-value from a contingency table:
1
observed = pd.crosstab(rlanders.Survey, rlanders.Gender)
2
chi2, p, df, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(observed)
3

print(”Chi-squared
: %.4f” % chi2)
5
print(”Degrees of freedom: %d” % df)
6
print(”P-value
: %.4f” % p)

Goodness-of-fit test
24/43
Goodness-of-fit test
The 𝜒2 test can also be used to determine whether a sample is
representative for the population.
Goodness-of-fit test
This test indicates to what degree a sample corresponds to a null
hypothesis regarding the distribution of a qualitative variable over
mutually exclusive classes.

Example
Is the distribution of the sample (𝑛= 400) representative for the full
population (all superheroes)?
●What numbers would you expect if the sample is representative?
●How large are the differences from the observed numbers?
○small ⇒distribution is representative
○large ⇒distribution is not representative

Example

population (all superheroes)?
●What numbers would you expect if the sample is representative?
●How large are the differences from the observed numbers?
○small ⇒distribution is representative
○large ⇒distribution is not representative
Can you see the link with contingency tables and Cramer’s V?
27/43
Goodness of fit test
●Exactly representative ⇒35% of superheroes in the sample is a
mutant
●The expected number therefore is 𝑒= 0.35 × 400 = 140.
Therefore:
𝑒= 𝑛× 𝜋
If the differences 𝑜−𝑒are relatively small they can be attributed to
random sampling errors.

𝜒2 =
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
(𝑜𝑖−𝑒𝑖)2

Draw a conclusion based on the value of 𝜒2:
●small ⇒distribution is representative
●large ⇒distribution is not representative
𝜒2 measures the degree of conflict with the null hypothesis

Goodness of fit test
●The test statistic 𝜒2 follows the 𝜒2 distribution.
●Critical value 𝑔from the 𝜒2 distribution: this is dependent on the
number of degrees of freedom (𝑑𝑓). In general:
𝑑𝑓= 𝑘−1
with 𝑘the number of categories.
●The critical value 𝑔for a given significance level 𝛼and number of
degrees of freedom 𝑑𝑓can be calculated in Python using the
function isf().
𝑃(𝜒2 < 𝑔) = 1 −𝛼
31/43
Goodness of fit test
Testing Procedure
1. Formulate hypotheses
○𝐻0: sample is representative for the population
○𝐻1: sample is not representative for the population
2. Choose significance level: 𝛼= 0.05

Goodness of fit test
Testing Procedure
1. Calculate test statistic:
𝜒2 =
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
(𝑜𝑖−𝑒𝑖)2
𝑒𝑖
1.1 Critical area: Calculate 𝑔so that 𝑃(𝜒2 < 𝑔) = 1 −𝛼
1.2 Probability value: Calculate 𝑝= 1 −𝑃(𝑋< 𝜒2)
2. Conclusion (the test is always right-tailed):
2.1 𝜒2 < 𝑔⇒do not reject 𝐻0, 𝜒2 > 𝑔⇒reject 𝐻0
2.2 𝑝> 𝛼⇒do not reject 𝐻0, 𝑝< 𝛼⇒reject 𝐻0
33/43
Example
●g = stats.chi2.isf(0.05, df=4) (result: 9.4877)
●p = stats.chi2.sf(3.4679, df=4) (result: 0.4828)
Conclusion. 𝜒2 ≈3.47 < 𝑔≈9.4877, so we don’t reject the null hypothesis.
This sample is representative for the population.

Consider all families with exactly 5 children in a given community.
Example: families
Consider all families with exactly 5 children in a given community. When
we look at the number of boys/girls, there are 6 possible combinations:
1. 5 boys
2. 4 boys, 1 girl
3. 3 boys, 2 girls
4. 2 boys, 3 girls
5. 1 boy, 4 girls
6. 5 girls
A survey was conducted regarding 1022 families with exactly 5 children
Are the observed numbers in the 6 classes representative for a
population in which the probability of having a boy is equal to the
probability of having a girl, or more concrete 0.5?

If the assumption is true, the probability 𝜋𝑖to have 𝑖boys is determined
by a binomial distribution with parameters 𝑛= 5 and 𝑝= 0.5. For example,
the probability to have 2 boys out of 5 children is equal to:
(0.5)2 × (1 −0.5)5−2 × (5
2)
In general (you don’t have to know why):
𝜋𝑖= (5

5!

1. Formulate both hypotheses
○𝐻0: the sample is representative for the population
○𝐻1: the sample is not representative for the population
2. Determine 𝛼and 𝑛: 𝛼= 0.01 and 𝑛= 1022.
3. Value of the test statistic in the sample:
𝜒2 =

∑

≈28.846
4. Calculate and plot critical area: The critical value is 15.0863. Our test
statistic is inside the critical area, so we can reject 𝐻0.

contribution to the value of 𝜒2.

𝑜𝑖−𝑛𝜋𝑖
√𝑛𝜋𝑖(1 −𝜋𝑖)
●𝑟𝑖∈[−2, 2] ⇒“acceptable” values
●𝑟𝑖< −2 ⇒underrepresented
●𝑟𝑖> 2 ⇒overrepresented
Conclusion: families in which all children are of the same gender are
overrepresented.
Cochran’s rules

Conditions
In order to apply the 𝜒2-test, the following conditions must be met (Rule
of Cochran)
1. For all categories, the expected frequency 𝑒must be greater than 1.
2. In a maximum of 20 % of the categories, the expected frequency 𝑒
may be less than 5.
