dispersion).
○Can calculate some descriptive measures for data using statistical
software (Python).

Learning goals
●Bivariate analysis
○Can quantify and appropriately test the relationship between two
variables.
○Can construct a simple linear model to show the relationship between
two or more variables.
●Time series analysis
○Can discuss some common models to predict time series and/or
detect anomalies.
○Can indicate the importance of testing the accuracy of a model in a
methodologically correct manner.
