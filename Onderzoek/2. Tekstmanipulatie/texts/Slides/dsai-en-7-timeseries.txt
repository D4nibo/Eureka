Time series and predictions
Time series
A time series is a sequence of observations of some variable over
time.
●Monthly demand for milk
●Annual intake of students at HOGENT
●Price of a share or bond on the stock exchange (hourly, daily, …)
●Number of HTTP requests per second for a website
●Evolution of disk usage on a backup server

Time series and predictions

quantity

●Budget planning to avoid shortcomings (operating budget,
marketing budget …)
●Procurement planning (e.g. storage capacity)
●Support for financial objectives
●Avoid uncertainty

Time series and predictions
Time series are a statistical problem: observations vary with time

●Level

Mathematical model time series
The simplest model:
𝑋𝑡= 𝑏+ 𝜀𝑡
(1)
●𝑋𝑡: estimate for time series, at time 𝑡
●𝑏: the level (a constant), based on observations 𝑥𝑡
●𝜀𝑡: random noise. We assume that 𝜀𝑡∼𝑁𝑜𝑟(𝜇= 0; 𝜎)
11/39
Mathematical model time series
We could also assume that there is a linear relationship:
𝑋𝑡= 𝑏0 + 𝑏1𝑡+ 𝜀𝑡
(2)
with level 𝑏0 and trend 𝑏1.
Equation 1 and 2 are special cases of the polynomial case:
𝑋𝑡= 𝑏0 + 𝑏1𝑡+ 𝑏2𝑡2 + ⋯+ 𝑏𝑛𝑡𝑛+ 𝜀𝑡
(3)
12/39
General expression time series
𝑋𝑡= 𝑓(𝑏0, 𝑏1, 𝑏2, … , 𝑏𝑛, 𝑡) + 𝜀𝑡
(4)
We make these assumptions:
●We consider two components of variability:
○the mean of the predictions changes with time
○the variations to this mean vary randomly
●The residuals of the model (𝑋𝑡−𝑥𝑡) have a constant variance in time
(homoscedastic)

Estimating the parameters
Make predictions based on the time series model:
1. select the most suitable model
2. estimation for parameters 𝑏𝑖(𝑖∶1, … , 𝑛) based on observations
The estimations
̂𝑏𝑖are selected so that they approximate the observed
values as close as possible.

Example: parameter estimation
●We select the constant model of Equation 1
●You choose which observations you use to determine ̂𝑏, e.g.
○First 70 observations: ̂𝑏=
1
70 ∑70
𝑡=1 𝑥𝑡= 346.4
○Last 50 observations: ̂𝑏=
1
50 ∑96
𝑡=47 𝑥𝑡= 290.68
16/39
Example: parameter estimation
If we want to model the observations with a linear function
𝑋𝑡= 𝑏0 + 𝑏1𝑡+ 𝜀𝑡, then we can use linear regression!

Moving average
18/39
Moving average
Moving Average
The moving average is a series of averages (means) of the last 𝑚
observations
●Notation: SMA
●Hide short-term fluctuations and show long-term trends
●Parameter 𝑚is the time window
𝑆𝑀𝐴(𝑡) =
𝑡
∑
𝑖=𝑘
𝑥𝑖
𝑚
(5)
with 𝑘= 𝑡−𝑚+ 1.

Example: “Golden cross”
Moving averages are used in the technical analysis of stock prices to
discover trends:
Weighted moving average
●For 𝑆𝑀𝐴, the weights of the observations are equal
●For a weighted moving average (𝑊𝑀𝐴), more recent observations
gain relatively more weight
●A specific form of this is single exponential smoothing or the
exponential moving average (EMA):
𝑋𝑡= 𝛼𝑥𝑡−1 + (1 −𝛼)𝑋𝑡−1
(6)
with 𝛼the smoothing constant (0 < 𝛼< 1), and 𝑡≥3
22/39
Exponential smoothing
Equation 6 is only valid from 𝑡= 3. Hence, we need to choose a suitable
value for 𝑋2 ourselves. There are several options:
●𝑋2 = 𝑥1
●𝑋2 = 1
𝑚∑𝑚
𝑖=1 𝑥𝑖(so the mean of the first 𝑚observations)
●make 𝑋2 equal to a specific objective

24/39
Why “exponential”?
𝑋𝑡= 𝛼𝑥𝑡−1 + (1 −𝛼)𝑋𝑡−1
= 𝛼𝑥𝑡−1 + (1 −𝛼) [𝛼𝑥𝑡−2 + (1 −𝛼)𝑋𝑡−2]
= 𝛼𝑥𝑡−1 + 𝛼(1 −𝛼)𝑥𝑡−2 + (1 −𝛼)2𝑋𝑡−2
or in general:
= 𝛼
𝑡−2
∑
𝑖=1
(1 −𝛼)𝑖−1𝑥𝑡−𝑖+ (1 −𝛼)𝑡−𝑖𝑋𝑡−𝑖, 𝑡≥2
In other words: older observations have an exponentially
smaller weight.

The speed at which the old observations are “forgotten” depends on the
value of 𝛼. For a value of 𝛼close to 1, old observations are quickly
forgotten, whereas for 𝛼close to 0, this goes less fast.

Forecasting
As a forecast for time 𝑡+ 𝑚(𝑚time units in the “future”), we always take
the last estimate of the level:
𝐹(𝑡+ 𝑚) = 𝑋𝑡
28/39
Double exponential smoothing
Basic exponential smoothing does not work well if there is a trend in the
data
Figure: Exponential smoothing with a trend: the errors keep getting bigger
Double exponential smoothing
We add an additional term to model the trend. We use 𝑏𝑡for the
estimation of the trend at time 𝑡> 1:
𝑋𝑡= 𝛼𝑥𝑡+ (1 −𝛼)(𝑋𝑡−1 + 𝑏𝑡−1)
𝑏𝑡= 𝛽(𝑋𝑡−𝑋𝑡−1) + (1 −𝛽)𝑏𝑡−1
with 0 < 𝛼< 1 and 0 < 𝛽< 1
●𝑏𝑡is an estimate for the slope of the trend line
●Added to the first equation to ensure that the trend is followed
●𝑋𝑡−𝑋𝑡−1 is positive or negative, this corresponds to an
increasing/decreasing trend

Double exponential smoothing
Again, there are different options for selecting the initial values:
𝑋1 = 𝑥1
𝑏1 = 𝑥2 −𝑥1
𝑏1 = 1

𝑏1 =
𝑥𝑛−𝑥1
𝑛−1
31/39
Predicting (forecasting)
To make a prediction (forecast) 𝐹(𝑡+ 1) for time 𝑡+ 1 we use:
𝐹(𝑡+ 1) = 𝑋𝑡+ 𝑏𝑡
or in general for time 𝑡+ 𝑚:
𝐹(𝑡+ 𝑚) = 𝑋𝑡+ 𝑚𝑏𝑡

Triple exponential smoothing
Some time series have recurring (seasonal) patterns, e.g.
34/39
Triple exponential smoothing
Or Holt-Winter’s Method
Notation:
●𝐿: length of the seasonal cycle (number of time units)
●𝑐𝑡: term that models the seasonal variations
●𝛾(gamma): smoothing factor for the seasonal variation

Quality of a time series model
Compare forecast results with actual observations, when they become
available:
●Mean absolute error: 𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1
𝑚∑𝑡+𝑚
𝑖=𝑡+1 |𝑥𝑖−𝐹𝑖|
●Mean squared error 𝑀𝑆𝐸= 1
𝑚∑𝑡+𝑚
𝑖=𝑡+1(𝑥𝑖−𝐹𝑖)2
If square root of MSE is well below standard deviation over all
observations, you have a good model!
