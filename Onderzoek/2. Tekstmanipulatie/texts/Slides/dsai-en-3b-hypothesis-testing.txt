Statistical Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis Idea that has yet to be proven: statement regarding the
numeric value of a population parameter
Hypothesis Test verification of a statement about the values of one or
multiple population parameters
Null Hypothesis (𝐻0) Base hypothesis, we start with assuming it is true
Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻1, 𝐻𝑎) Conclusion if the null hypothesis is
unlikely to be true
5/37
Elements of a testing procedure
Test Statistic The value that is calculated from the sample
Region of Acceptance The region of values supporting the null
hypothesis
Critical Region / Region of Rejection The region of values rejecting the
null hypothesis
Significance Level The probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis 𝐻0
6/37
Testing procedure
1. Formulate both hypotheses (𝐻0 and 𝐻1)
2. Determine the significance level (𝛼)
3. Calculate the test statistic
4. Determine the critical region or the probability value
5. Draw conclusions

Assume that, over a period of 30 days, on average 3.483 people were
saved each day (𝑥= 3.483, 𝑛= 30)
1. Hypothesis: 𝐻0 ∶𝜇= 3.3; 𝐻1 ∶𝜇> 3.3
2. Significance level: 𝛼= 0.05
3. Test statistic: 𝑥= 3.483
Standard deviation of the population (assumed to be known): 𝜎= 0.55

12/37
Probability Value
𝑝-value
The 𝑝-value is the probability, if the null hypothesis is true, to obtain a
value for the test statistic that is at least as extreme as the observed
value.
●𝑝-value < 𝛼⇒reject 𝐻0: the discovered value of 𝑥is too extreme;
●𝑝-value ≥𝛼⇒do not reject 𝐻0: the discovered value of 𝑥can still be
explained by coincidence.

Critical Region
Critical region
The critical region is the collection of all values of the test statistic for
which we can reject the null hypothesis.
We look for a critical value 𝑔for which:
𝑃(𝑀> 𝑔) = 𝛼
Determine 𝑧𝛼for which:
𝑃(𝑍> 𝑧𝛼) = 𝛼⇒𝑔= 𝜇+ 𝑧𝛼. 𝜎

Left-tailed testing
What would you have to change in the equation in order to calculate the
correct critical value?
18/37
Left-tailed testing
What would you have to change in the equation in order to calculate the
correct critical value? Answer:
𝑔= 𝜇−𝑧× 𝜎
√𝑛
because
𝑃(𝑀< 𝑔) = 𝑃(𝑍< 𝑔−𝜇
𝜎
√𝑛
) = 0.05
18/37
Left-tailed testing
Because of symmetry:
𝑃(𝑍> −(𝑔−𝜇
𝜎
√𝑛
)) = 0.05
The corresponding 𝑧-value is 1.645, and therefore:
𝑧= −𝑔+ 𝜇

⇔−𝑔= 𝜎

⇔𝑔= 𝜇−𝑧𝛼

Two-tailed testing
Sometimes it can be necessary to perform a two-tailed test. In this case,
two critical values need to be calculated, namely the left and right critical
value.

Table: Summary of Testing Procedures
Requirements for 𝑧-test
●The sample needs to be random
●The sample size needs to be sufficiently large (𝑛≥30)
●The test statistic needs to have a normal distribution
●The standard deviation of the population, 𝜎, is known
Sometimes these assumptions will not hold and in this case we can not
use the 𝑍-test!

Examples
23/37
Example 1
When drawing a random sample consisting of 50 observations from a
population with variance 𝜎2 = 55 we obtain as sample mean 𝑥= 25.
We now want to find out if there is a reason to assume that the
population mean is smaller than 27.

Example 1
1 Formulate both hypotheses
𝐻0 ∶𝜇= 27 en 𝐻1 ∶𝜇< 27.
2 Determine significance level 𝛼and sample size 𝑛
𝛼= 0.05 en 𝑛= 50

4a Probability Value
According to the central limit theorem:
𝑀∼𝑁𝑜𝑟(𝜇= 27, 𝜎2
√𝑛
)
𝑧= 𝑥−𝜇
𝜎
√𝑛
= 25 −27

≈−1.91
We therefore have a probability value of 0.0281.
Using a significance level of 0.05, we can reject 𝐻0.

5 Conclusion
We can conclude, based on the sample, that 𝜇< 27 for a
significance level of 0.05

Example 2
In a reseach about the amount of change in the pockets of our
superheroes, researchers state that on average a superhero carries €25
of cash. We assume that the standard deviation of the population 𝜎= 7.
For a random sample of size 𝑛= 64, the average amount of money a
superhero carries is 𝑥= €23. For the significance level, 𝛼= 0.05 is selected.
30/37
Example 2
1 Formulate both hypotheses
𝐻0 ∶𝜇= 25 en 𝐻1 ∶𝜇≠25
2 Determine significance level 𝛼and sample size 𝑛
𝛼= 0.05 en 𝑛= 64.
3 Test statistic & value: 𝑥= 23

Example 2 (cont.)
4b Calculate the critical region
𝑔1 = 𝜇−𝑧× 𝜎
√𝑛
= 23.28
𝑔2 = 𝜇+ 𝑧× 𝜎
√𝑛
= 26.72
We have that 𝑥is inside the critical region (because
23 < 23.28) so we can reject 𝐻0.
5 Based on this sample we can conclude that superheroes
carry on average less than 25 €, using a significance level of
5%

Student’s t-test
33/37
Student’s t-test
What if the requirements for a 𝑧-test are not met? E.g.
●Sample size too small
●Population stdev (𝜎) unknown
If the variable is normally distributed, you can use the 𝑡-test
34/37
The 𝑡-test
Determine critical value:
𝑔= 𝜇± 𝑡× 𝑠
√𝑛
●𝑡-value is derived from the Student’s 𝑡-distribution, based on the
number of degrees of freedom, 𝑛−1
●Look for value using the function t.isf() in Python
●Apart from this, the procedure is identical to the procedure of the
𝑧-test
