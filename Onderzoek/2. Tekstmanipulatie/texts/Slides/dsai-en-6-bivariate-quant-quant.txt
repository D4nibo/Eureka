Data visualization
To visualize quantitative data, we use a scatter plot
●X-axis: independent variable
●Y-axis: dependent variable
●Each point corresponds to an observation

Linear regression
8/28
Linear Regression
With regression we will try to find a consistent and systematic
relationship between two quantitative variables.
1. Monotonic: consistent direction of the relationship between the two
variables: increasing or decreasing
2. Non-monotonic: value of dependent variable changes
systematically with value of independent variable, but the direction
is not consistent
9/28
Linear Regression
A linear relationship between an independent and dependent variable.
Characteristics:
●Presence: is there a relationship?
●Direction: increasing or decreasing?
●Strength of the relationship: strong, moderate, weak, nonexistent, …

Equation
The regression line has the following equation:
̂𝑦= 𝛽1𝑥+ 𝛽0
with:
𝛽1 =
∑𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑥𝑖−𝑥)(𝑦𝑖−𝑦)
∑𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑥−𝑥)2
≈29375.49
756.47
≈38.83
𝛽0 = 𝑦−𝛽1𝑥≈3891.27 −38.83 × 199.82 ≈−3868.33
̂𝑦= 38.83𝑥−3868.33
Note:
̂𝑦indicates “an estimation for 𝑦”

Covariance

Covariance
Covariance
Covariance is a measure that indicates whether a relationship
between two variables is increasing or decreasing.
Cov(𝑋, 𝑌) =
1
𝑛−1
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
(𝑥𝑖−𝑥)(𝑦𝑖−𝑦)
Cov > 0: increasing
Cov ≈0: no relationship
Cov < 0: decreasing
Note Covariance of population (denominator 𝑛)
vs. sample (denominator 𝑛−1)

Covariance

Covariance
𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋, 𝑌) ≈29375.49
17 −1
≈1835.97
●𝐶𝑜𝑣> 0 ⇒increasing relationship
●What if body mass was expressed in kg instead of g?
Covariance has limited use as a measure of the relationship between
two variables.

Pearson correlation coefficient
Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient
Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient 𝑅is a measure for
the strength of a linear correlation between 𝑥and 𝑦
𝑅= 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋, 𝑌)
𝜎𝑥𝜎𝑦

∑𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑥𝑖−𝑥)(𝑦𝑖−𝑦)

Coefficient of determination
24/28
Coefficient of determination
Coefficient of determination
The coefficient of determination 𝑅2 explains the percentage of the
variance of the observed values relative to the regression line.
𝑅2: percentage variance observations explained by the regression line
1 −𝑅2: percentage variance observations not explained by regression

Strength of relationship
Example chinstrap penguins
𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋, 𝑌) ≈29375.49

≈1835.97
𝑅= 𝐶𝑜𝑣(𝑋, 𝑌)
𝜎𝑥𝜎𝑦
≈
1835.968
6.876 × 322.935 ≈0.827
𝑅2 ≈0.8272 ≈0.684
Conclusion: There is a strong linear and increasing relationship between
flipper length and body mass of male chinstrap penguins. 68.4% of the
variance in body mass can be explained by the variance in flipper length.
Considerations
●The correlation coefficient only looks at the relationship between
two variables. Interactions with other variables are not considered.
●The correlation coefficient explicitly does not assume a causal
relationship.
●Pearson’s correlation coefficient only expresses linear relationships.
