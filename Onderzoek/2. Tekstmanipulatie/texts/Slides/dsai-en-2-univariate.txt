The arithmetic mean (notation: 𝑥) is the sum of all values divided by
the number of values

Q2 The arithmetic mean of 15 numbers is 12. What number
should be added to get a mean of 13?

Median
Median
To find the median, sort all values and pick the middle number
●Odd number of values: no problem
●Even number of values: average of the middle two

Quartiles
Quartiles
The quartiles of a sorted set of numbers are the three values that
divide the set into 4 equally large subsets. Notation: 𝑄1, 𝑄2, 𝑄3

Calculating Quartiles
●Different software programs have slightly different ways of
calculating quartiles.
●The following method is easy to perform by hand. Start by sorting
the values.
○When 𝑛is odd.
– The median (𝑄2) is the middle value (as before).
– Leave out the median. 𝑄1 is the median of the first half, 𝑄3 is the median
of the second half.
○When 𝑛is even.
– The median (𝑄2) is the average of the two middle values.
– 𝑄1 is the median of the first half, 𝑄3 is the median
of the second half.

Interquartile Range (IQR)
Interquartile Range
The interquartile range is the difference between the third and first
quartile |𝑄3 −𝑄1|.

Variance and Standard Deviation
Variance
The variance (𝑠2 or 𝜎2) is the mean squared difference between the
values of a data set and the arithmetic mean.
𝑠2 =
1
𝑛−1
𝑛
∑
𝑖=1
(𝑥𝑖−𝑥)2
Standard deviation
The standard deviation (𝑠or 𝜎) is the square root of the variance

Properties of the Standard
Deviation
Why 𝑛−1 in the denominator and not 𝑛?
You can prove the reason for the change mathematically, but we will
investigate it empirically

This news item reports on high prices for houses and flats. Do the
numbers give a good idea of the situation?
Remember!
Providing only a center value is never sufficient!
●What is the dispersion?
●How is the data distributed? Normal distribution?
●Is the group sufficiently homogeneous?

Pie Chart
Attention!
Avoid using a pie chart!
Disadvantages:
●Comparing angles is harder than comparing length
●Unusable for data with many categories

Interpretation of Charts
Tips:
●Label the axes
●Add a clear title
●Name the unit (and, if
necessary, order of magnitude)
●Add a label that clarifies the
chart

= misrepresenting data so that invalid conclusions are drawn

Data distraction
●Avoid bells and whistles
●Minimize “ink to data” ratio

same measurements of central tendency and dispersion.
