What to monitor?
Anything that matters for your business! -> monitoring targets
Demand
Workload
Availability, performance, faults/errors
Resources (technical metrics)
e.g. CPU, connection pool capacity, …
Business metrics

Early monitoring solutions: Alerting
Nagios, Icinga, Zmon, Sensu, …
Regularly execute checks (scripts)
Nonzero exit status? Generate alert!

Early monitoring solutions: Graphing
E.g. Graphite, mrtg
Backed by time series database filled with metrics
Separate tool for data collection (e.g. collectd, statsd)

#monitoringsucks
Trending in 2011
Cloud (r)evolution
Scaling up, automation
Servers as pets -> servers as cattle
Many tools, not suited for new needs
Not scalable
Manual approach to system administration
Too many alerts

Characteristics
Graphing/alerting are separate
Manual approach to system administration
No specific tools for log mgmt (tail, grep, awk!)

Monitoring in a DevOps world
Integrated
metrics, logging, alerting, visualisation
Self service
Service discovery
Dynamic
New nodes, destroyed nodes, …
Collaborative
Shared between all disciplines within the team
Observable applications
Applications provide their own instrumentation
Devs should implement this!

Synthetic monitoring
End user (experience) monitoring
System monitoring
Network monitoring
Software metrics
Application monitoring

Synthetic monitoring
= generate traffic that simulates user interaction
Is the application available for users?
Simulate interactions programmatically
Generates extra load!

End user monitoring
= gather data from real end user activity
Response times
Error rates
Number of user interactions
User metadata (device type, OS version, geolocation, …)
More variation in interactions
No extra load

System monitoring
This is what we are most familiar with!
CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network I/O, …
Per process/per container/per VM metrics
Kernel metrics, syscalls, …
System monitoring does not show whether your application is
available to users!

Network monitoring
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Implemented in most network devices!
Key metrics:
bandwith utilization
packet processing rates
latency
interface error rates
Should be observed for every device on routing path of service

Software metrics
Some 3rd party applications already expose performance metrics
Not standardized, different for each application
Usually, plugins exist to integrate in your monitoring solution

Application Monitoring
i.e. the application that your customers use and that your business
generates income from!
Often blind spot!
Application problems:
App logic flaws
Capacity constraints
Dependency failures
Measuring app health:
Transaction throughput (e.g. #completed reqs/s)
Response times
Error rates (e.g. HTTP 2xx, 4xx, 5xx)

Log monitoring
System and application logs
Often best way to determine what went wrong and to find how to fix
it
Application logs only work if devs have the app generate logs!
Has its own set of specialised tooling (e.g. ELK stack, Splunk, Grafana
Loki, …)

I find that putting [devs] on call and making them figure out what’s
going on in their application from their own logs, is the absolute
fastest way to improve their logging.

Putting it all together
Enormous amount of metrics can be monitored
Granularity also has impact
every 1s, 10s, 1m, …?
Determine what is most important for your situation
Don’t forget about application monitoring
Devs should make their apps observable!
Share dashboards with application owners

Components
Prometheus server:
scrapes, stores TS data
:
for instrumenting application code
for exposing metrics so Prometheus can scrape them
e.g. Node exporter for basic system metrics
also: MySQL, Kubernetes, SNMP, …
AlertManager
…
Client libraries
Exporters
